Welcome to pyRVT
================

Welcome to pyRVT's documentation. pyRVT is library library for seismological
random vibration theory (RVT).  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  I recommend that you get started with
:ref:`installation` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
Besides the quickstart, there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial`.  If
you'd rather dive into the internals of pyRVT, check out
the :ref:`api` documentation.
